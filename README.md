# TSF_Social_IntegrationApp
This is an app made in Android Studio using Java. The key areas i've focused on is the UI of the app. Its functions are very basic--consists of drop-downs for entry 
of mail id and password to login through LinkedIn and Facebook. The second activity enlists the user details fetched from SQLiteDatabase made in the Java class.
